This challenge works with a custom-designed markup language HRML. In HRML, each element consists of a starting and ending tag, and there are attributes associated with each tag. Only starting tags can have attributes. We can call an attribute by referencing the tag, followed by a tilde, '~' and the name of the attribute. The tags may also be nested.

The opening tags follow the format:

<tag-name attribute1-name = "value1" attribute2-name = "value2" ...>

The closing tags follow the format:

</tag-name>

The attributes are referenced as:

tag1~value  
tag1.tag2~name
Given the source code in HRML format consisting of N lines, answer Q queries. For each query, print the value of the attribute specified. Print "Not Found!" if the attribute does not exist.

Example

HRML listing
<tag1 value = "value">
<tag2 name = "name">
<tag3 another="another" final="final">
</tag3>
</tag2>
</tag1>

Queries
tag1~value
tag1.tag2.tag3~name
tag1.tag2~value
Here, tag2 is nested within tag1, so attributes of tag2 are accessed as tag1.tag2~<attribute>. Results of the queries are:

Query                 Value
tag1~value            "value"
tag1.tag2.tag3~name   "Not Found!"
tag1.tag2.tag3~final  "final"

Constraints
1<= N <=20
1<= Q<= 20

Each line in the source program contains, at most, 200 characters.
Every reference to the attributes in the  Q queries contains at most 200 characters.
All tag names are unique and the HRML source program is logically correct, i.e. valid nesting.
A tag can may have no attributes.

Output Format

Print the value of the attribute for each query. Print "Not Found!" without quotes if the attribute does not exist.

Sample Input

4 3
<tag1 value = "HelloWorld">
<tag2 name = "Name1">
</tag2>
</tag1>
tag1.tag2~name
tag1~name
tag1~value


Sample Output

Name1
Not Found!
HelloWorld
